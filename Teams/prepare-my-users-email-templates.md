# <a name="facilitate-user-adoption-of-your-new-online-phone-system"></a>新しいオンライン電話システムのユーザーの導入を容易にする

電話はユーザーの生存線にすることができます。 従来の電話システムからオンライン電話システムに切り替えることは、ユーザーが作業する方法の大幅な変更を意味し、生産性に悪影響を与える可能性があります。 この変更によってユーザーの通知、ガイド、サポートを行うことができます。これにより、ユーザーエクスペリエンスを向上させ、投資収益率を最大限に高めることができます。

この記事には、新しい電話システムについてユーザーに通知するためのカスタマイズ可能なメールテンプレートが含まれています。 特定の音声展開に合わせて、適切なメールをカスタマイズして送信します。 簡単にカスタマイズできるセクションを示すために、かっこを使用しましたが、ユーザーにとって最も関連性の高いお知らせとなるように、組織固有のメッセージを追加することをお勧めします。 展開に該当する場合は、"Teams" へのすべての参照を "Skype for Business" に置き換えます。

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

メールの本文:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can’t be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it’s easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can’t be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

We understand this is a big shift in the way you make calls today and want to
ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <INSERT DATE>, but you can start preparing today.

CALL TO ACTION

    taking advantage of Teams IM and meetings capabilities, get
    started today by visiting https://aka.ms/F63e30.

    an approved headset. You can view available options or order yours <INSERT LINK>. We'll

    PC. To view available training, visit https://aka.ms/B6fx7u to get started.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

メールの本文:

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it’s
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
